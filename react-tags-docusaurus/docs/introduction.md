React-tags is a simple tagging component ready to drop in your projects. The component is inspired by GMail's *To* field in the compose window.

## Features
- Autocomplete based on a suggestion list
- Keyboard friendly and mouse support
- Reorder tags using drag and drop
- Edit tag support
- Optional clear all button

## Why
Started by [Prakhar Srivastav](https://github.com/prakhar1989) and later maintained by [Aakansha Doshi](https://github.com/ad1992).

In Prakhar's words here is why he started itüëáüèª

Because I was looking for an excuse to build a standalone component and publish it in the wild? To be honest, I needed a tagging component that provided the above features for my [React-Surveyman](http://github.com/prakhar1989/react-surveyman) project. Since I was unable to find one which met my requirements (and the fact that I generally enjoy re-inventing the wheel) this is what I came up with.
