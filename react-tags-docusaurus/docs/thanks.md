# Thanks

The autocomplete dropdown is inspired by Lea Verou's [awesomeplete](https://github.com/LeaVerou/awesomplete) library. The Drag and drop functionality is provided by Dan Abramov's insanely useful [ReactDND](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) library.

Also thanks to the awesome contributors who've made the library far better!
